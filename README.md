# Herodotus Visualization
Herodotus is a crater on the moon.  
This assignment was to draw a crater you found based on your calculations.  
I made this visualization that allows you to view the crater in 3D.  
It was created in Unity, and is hosted --> https://tehlor.github.io/HerodotusVisualization/
